# Voyage into the Unknown - Space Animation

Welcome to the **Voyage into the Unknown** web experience! This project uses **Three.js** to create an immersive, space-themed animation that transports viewers into the depths of the cosmos. The animation employs a composite image technique, a glowing orb effect, and a dynamic star field to simulate a voyage through space. A typographic story unfolds as you interact with the page, enhancing the feeling of exploration and discovery.

## Features

- **Three.js-Based Animation**: Uses Three.js to generate a realistic 3D star field and planets, simulating a journey through space.
- **Glowing Orb Effect**: A pulsating orb effect, representing a celestial object, is positioned in front of the scene.
- **Interactive Dialogue Box**: Clicking the question mark icon triggers a narrative dialogue box that types out the story of the journey.
- **Soundtrack**: Background music plays a soothing track as the stars and planets move, adding to the cosmic atmosphere.

## How It Works

1. **Foreground Image**: A fixed, full-screen image acts as the foreground for the animation. The image has a subtle wobble animation to simulate a sense of movement or instability.
2. **Star Field**: Thousands of stars are rendered with varying sizes, speeds, and colors to create a dynamic star field. The stars move toward the camera to simulate the zooming effect of space travel.
3. **Planets**: Static planets orbit the scene with slow, randomized rotations to add depth to the environment.
4. **Dialogue**: When you click the **?** icon, a dialogue box appears with a story about the voyage, typed out gradually to give the feeling of a live narration.
